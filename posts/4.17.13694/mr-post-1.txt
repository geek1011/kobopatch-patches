This is the [B]largest release[/B] (both for the patches and firmware) so far. The work for this release spanned over 3 firmware versions and took many hours of time (it usually only takes ~1 hour) from multiple contributors. A extra large thanks goes to [B]jackie_w[/B] and [B]NiLuJe[/B] for their extensive (at least 10 hours) of work for this release. Jackie put a lot of work and effort into updating and rewriting nickel patches, and she testing and cross-verified everything I updated. NiLuJe reviewed code for the kobopatch build script, my dotfiles mod for 4.17.13651, and the patch documentation. See the release notes below for full credits.
