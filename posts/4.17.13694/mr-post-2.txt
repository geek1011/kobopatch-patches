[U][B]Changes to the kobopatch zip:[/B][/U]
[B]v52 (2019-09-21)[/B]: Everything (no, really, literally everything changed). This is the largest patches release so far. See [URL="https://github.com/geek1011/kobopatch-patches/releases/tag/v52"]here[/URL] for the details.

[B][U]Missing patches:[/U][/B]
- My 24 line spacing values (waiting for GeoffR to update).
- Custom font sizes (waiting for GeoffR to update).

[B][U]Patches for other files / patches not in the main zip:[/U][/B]
- GeoffR's variant of my toc indentation patch: [SPOILER][CODE]Increase TOC level indentation and fix extra indentation bug (GeoffR's variant):
  - Enabled: yes
  - PatchGroup: TOC Indentation
  - Description: |
      The space indented Table of Contents levels are quite hard to see, as the
      difference is almost too small to easily notice. In addition, this fixes
      the bug where all TOC entries are indented by 1 level extra.
