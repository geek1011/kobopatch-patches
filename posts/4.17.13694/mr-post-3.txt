For convenience, here are the release notes copied from [URL="https://github.com/geek1011/kobopatch-patches/releases/tag/v52"]GitHub[/URL] (please do not quote this post):

[SIZE=5]v52[/SIZE]
This is the initial release for 4.17.13694 (plus 4.17.13651 and 4.16.13337 which were released the same week).  This is one of the largest releases of both the patches and the firmware (the new reader interface, and quite a bit of refactoring since 4.15.12920).

This release would not have been possible without the extensive work of:[LIST]
[*]jackie_w (@jackiew1), who did the majority of the testing, rewrote many CSS patches, worked on new patches, and helped find changes in the new firmware.
[*]GeoffR (@geoffreynolds), who made many of the original patches, and who will probably update a few more patches for the next release.
[*]NiLuJe (@NiLuJe), who provided help and code review where it was needed (and helped with another kobo-related project which will be made public soon).
[*]davidfor (@davidfor), who provided some information about the new firmware features on MobileRead.
[*]geek1011 (@geek1011), who updated the majority of the patches, worked on new patches, wrote the build script, and helped find changes in the new firmware.
[*]Kobo, who created the new reader interface, and fixed many bugs over the last few firmware releases.
[/LIST]
